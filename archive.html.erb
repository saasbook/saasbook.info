      <h2>Testimonials from the First Edition</h2>

      <p><img src="assets/images/icons/US.png" />“I took the CS169.1x and CS169.2x MOOCs in the fall and winter, and I
wanted to send you a long-overdue thanks for all of your amazing work…I
graduated from UC Irvine in 2004 with bachelors in CS and had worked for
many years as a .NET developer, but last year I decided to make a big
transition to start working with more”startup-y” tech stacks. CS169 is
so much more than just a Rails class or an intro to building SaaS apps.
You somehow managed to build a course that encompasses almost everything
about modern software development, but under the guise of building Rails
SaaS apps. Hilariously, despite my focus on iOS and Objective-C, your
class is most directly responsible for my successful transition. Every
single day at work, I use what I learned about the importance of unit
tests (especially for refactoring!), the wisdom and pitfalls of agile
development, SOLID/DRY/design patterns, etc. This knowledge gives me a
clear edge over others.  It’s rare to have someone break down complex
topics in easily digestible chunks and connect all the disparate
concepts of software development into a cohesive whole. Thanks for
making a difference. I owe you a beer or three.”  <em>Richard Shin, San
Francisco, USA</em></p>

<p>As an on-the-job trained C# WinForms programmer, this course was
instrumental in extending my conceptual understanding of our web-based
components. Additionally, the soup-to-nuts tour through a largely
foreign language, framework, and tool-set was a wonderful
mini-simulation of joining a new development shop. <em>  Russell
Speight, Springbrook Software, Inc. Portland, OR</em></p>
<p><em><br />

<p><img src="assets/images/icons/US.png" /></p>
<p>“I graduated from Rice with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science
in 2006, and I’ve worked at a bunch of different tech companies…I
recently left Amazon and I have to say, if I had taken this course
before my more recent stint over there, my time would have been a LOT
better spent, and I’d have been able to understand a lot of methodology
decisions that were (implicitly) made in my team, and influence others
better, especially with having seen a ton of the studies and data on
software engineering projects you guys mention early on in the
book/course…the course has especially re-interested me in computer
science and building software again…just wanted to give one (among many
many I’m sure) direct response of <em>thank you.</em>”  <em>Tom Mowad,
Seattle, USA</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><img src="assets/images/icons/US.png" /></p>
<p>“For professionals working in industries reliant on legacy software
development models and tools, this course offers vital insight into far
more contemporary development practices and tools. Courses such as this
present an invaluable opportunity to stay relevant in today’s
increasingly cloud-based world, especially for those who may not have
the opportunity to be exposed to these topics in their day to day jobs.”

Diego, CA</em></p>

<p>“A fast-paced introduction to building high-quality web applications.
You get exposed to some of the best software engineering practices while
learning a modern development framework and very productive tools.”
 <em>Francisco Hoyos, </em></p>

<p>“When I took the Engineering SaaS course, I was a senior bachelor
student in software engineering at Shiraz University in Iran. Back then
I had no idea that this course was going to change my life. It changed
the way I code today, my views on testing and how it can be fun instead
of painful, and how to manage a software project in the best way
possible. Now I use those software project management principles in both
my work and daily life….I think taking this course was one of the best
decisions I’ve ever made in my life.”  <em>Arash Pourhabibi-Zarandi,
Shiraz University, Iran, and EPFL, Switzerland</em></p>
<p><img src="assets/images/icons/ES.png" /></p>
<p>“I am a Telecommunications Engineer with a deep love for software and
coding who was stuck doing a networking job I didn’t really enjoy.  I
took your course with great interest and got a Verified Certificate.
When I interviewed for FinancialForce.com, a software company located in
my home town in Spain, I couldn’t believe how many of the things I was
being asked I already knew from the SaaS course!  It was a great
experience.  The emphasis on testing given in the course finally made me
land a job as an Automated Test Engineer, and after working there for a
few months, I couldn’t be happier.  I wanted to personally thank you for
doing an incredibly good job with the course and its contents—the effort
is worth if it can change people’s lives around the world like it did
for me. Thank you Armando, Dave, Sam and everyone else.”  <em>Miguel
Cabrera-García, Granada, Spain</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><img src="assets/images/icons/ES.png" /></p>
<p>“I was totally discouraged with college and with the Computer Science
degrees here in Spain.  And then, in summer holidays, I found the
Berkeley MOOC SaaS course. And what you and David were teaching was so
different from my college classes…And I loved it, it was so cool
compared with my Java and classic project management classes… Even
though it was hard for me at first, I completed both courses, and I
loved them.  In Spain nobody asks for volunteer internships, and I was
shocked about how Berkeley students work with nonprofit organizations to
get their hands dirty with real projects…That encouraged me and made me
look for a company that works in that way, and even in my not very big
city (Valencia), I only had to send one email to get a”yes, come here
and learn with us.”  So I become an intern with a great group of folks
who became my mentors from day one. Now I’m finishing my degree with my
final project being done with Rails and and agile practices (something
totally new in my college), and I have two job offers in my own city
before finishing college. I suppose that you receive tons of emails like
mine, but I couldn’t resist to thank you and tell you how you and David
changed my life with your MOOC SaaS courses.”  <em>Marc Sardón,
Valencia, Spain</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><img src="assets/images/icons/ID.png" /></p>
<p>“When we took your class we were working on setting up our own
business which involved building a SaaS application. We learned how to
use Agile, BDD and TDD to develop and test our application and speed up
the delivery of our services…A year after that we won a contract from
the Indonesian Airports Authority Angkasa Pura I (AP1) for the system of
their procurement services. The concepts we learned in class helped us
to develop and deploy the application in only two months time. The
service we built has been used for almost a year at AP1 and has helped
in providing 15% savings from their purchases which translates into
almost double increase in profits for the company. [Now] to move on
quickly we need financing to build our organization, raise awareness and
educate corporate clients and regulators, roll out service to additional
clients (our second client has just signed up), recruit and educate more
suppliers and deploy a scalable infrastructure. We have met a few VCs
from the region since the beginning of this year and one in particular
has been in advance talks with regards to the financing of our business
so wish us luck!”  <em>Reza Anwar and Tanti Ruwani, Jakarta,
Indonesia</em></p>
